## Data-structure

before we start fully with data structure and algorithm
we first of have to understand some concepts right ??

1. what is Data ?
2. what is Data-structure ?
3. why Data-Structure ?

if we are able to answer these three question I think and believe
good to go with Data-structure.

* so what is DATA ?
    as we all know in basic computer, data is what ? 
    an unprocessed raw facts right ?? the data can be
    any type such as images, documents, numbers, strings
    that can be processed by the computer.

* then now what is Data-Structure ?
    Data structure is a way of storing data in the 
    computer, so it can be used efficiently.
    its basically the art of arranging the data in
    a way that allows the computer to perform operations
    on the data efficiently.

## why do we need DATA-STRUCTURE ?

in the early days of programming, programmeers only have one 
wish or mechanism of anaylysing code, which is ?? 😂 guess you
must have known the answer 😂😂, tell me nahhhh 🙏🙏, you don't 
want to talk abi ?? ok oo let me answer which is *("is the code working?")
once their code is working that is like the deal breaker for them.
it made sense that way, not untill developers started noticing that 
two or different persons can actually solve or implement a task in different
ways and still get the same result, and now that their codes that were working
initially, they started to observer that, is like one's code runs faster than 
other right ??, that is when they started doing what ??, looking for a way to manage
the data's which was making the slow
