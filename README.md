## Data-structure

before we start fully with data structure and algorithm
we first of have to understand some concepts right ??

1. what is Data ?
2. what is Data-structure ?
3. why Data-Structure ?

if we are able to answer these three question I think and believe
good to go with Data-structure.

* so what is DATA ?
    as we all know in basic computer, data is what ? 
    an unprocessed raw facts right ?? the data can be
    any type such as images, documents, numbers, strings
    that can be processed by the computer.

* then now what is Data-Structure ?
    Data structure is a way of storing data in the 
    computer, so it can be used efficiently.
    its basically the art of arranging the data in
    a way that allows the computer to perform operations
    on the data efficiently.

## why do we need DATA-STRUCTURE ?

in the early days of programming, programmeers only have one 
wish or mechanism of anaylysing code, which is ?? ðŸ˜‚ guess you
must have known the answer
